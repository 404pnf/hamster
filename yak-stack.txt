* Document Enumerable and the expected protocol (ie #each, #filter, #drop, or whatever).
* Set#sort should probably return a SortedSet.
* More efficient initialisation of Hash/Set (ie Trie), and Vector by not copying.
* Should mutable variants wrap results (eg #tail) in a mutable?
* Methods should accept 1 or many.
* Make Trie.include Immutable
* Make List#size not O(n)!
* Add List #fill, #sample, #insert, #insert_by, #permutation (aliased as #permutations), #subsequences, #transpose
* Add Set #cycle, #sample
* Add Hash #count, #partition, #one?, #sort, #sort_by, #max(imum), #min(imum), #cycle, #clear, #key
* Work out what we can extract into common "Enumerable-like" code.
* Generate spec docs
* Add missing immutability tests to Set
* Add missing immutability tests to Hash
* Add missing immutability tests to Stack
* Re-write Trie test-first (it was only a spike)
* Implement a circular queue based on a queue that enqueues on every dequeue.
* Should RCU collections return RCU collections? Eg. RCUSet#map -> RCUSet
