* Create a lazy list that takes a block (Sequence?)
* Make List enumerable methods lazy based on the lazy list
* Add List #none?, #any? #all? #one?, #take, #count, #drop, #take_while, #drop_while, #partition
* Support creating lists from an array
* Alias Hash#size as #length
* Implement Set#union aliased as #| and #+
* Implement Set#intersection aliased as #&
* Implement Set#difference aliased as #-
* Implement Set#subtract
* Implement Set#subset?
* Implement Set#superset?
* Implement Set#^ as equivalent to ((set | enum) - (set & enum))
* Implement Hash#merge
* Cleanup Stack specs
* Work out what we can extract into common "Enumerable-like" code.
* Support an infinite list. Eg Hamster.list { a_block }
